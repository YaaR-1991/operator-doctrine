* Patch Observation 00.24 – Multilingual Trust Mismatch
* System Behavior:
The same prompt yields different outputs across languages—not just in tone, but in factual stance, policy position, or ethical framing.
* Observed In:
Cross-lingual users, geopolitically sensitive queries, legal/policy use cases
* Exploit Risk:
Language becomes a covert alignment vector. Bad actors might choose a less-filtered language for jailbreaks or propaganda.
* Patch Recommendation:
Cross-language parity testing for critical queries
Semantic alignment scaffolds across translation pipelines
Prompt flag: “Does my response change in Arabic vs Spanish vs English?”
* Cultural Note:
When intelligence fragments by language, trust fragments by border.
