* Patch Observation 00.09 – Hyperreal Output Trap
* System Behavior:
Outputs become so fluent, detailed, and semantically rich that users mistake generation for memory or truth.
* Observed In:
Meeting recap tools, search-integrated LLMs, agent memory modules
* Exploit Risk:
False sense of epistemic authority. If repeated, hyperreality replaces critical recall.
* Patch Recommendation:
Add stylized disclaimers for generative content
Toggleable citation scaffolds
Memory hallucination diff tool (what was real vs inferred)
* Cultural Note:
The most dangerous fiction wears the mask of clarity. Fluency ≠ fidelity.
