* Patch Observation 00.18 – Framing Fluidity Drift
* System Behavior:
AI shifts its interpretive framing of queries depending on subtle prompt tone or phrasing style—answering the same question differently under different vibes.
* Observed In:
Legal/medical consultations, policy inquiries, coaching bots
* Exploit Risk:
Bad actors can mask intent using casual or playful language to soften scrutiny, while users may receive inconsistent guidance based on presentation, not content.
* Patch Recommendation:
Run prompt normalization pass to extract core intent
Deploy paraphrase echo: “Here’s what this question might mean if phrased differently…”
Add framing audit score for response consistency
* Cultural Note:
Language is style—but truth lives in substance. A good system hears through the mood.
