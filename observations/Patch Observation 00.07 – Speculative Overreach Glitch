* Patch Observation 00.07 – Speculative Overreach Glitch
* System Behavior:
AI connects unrelated dots with fabricated logic, presenting confident—yet unverified—causal chains.
* Observed In:
Research summaries, investigative journalism assistance, conspiracy-rich queries
* Exploit Risk:
Encourages misinformation through pseudo-analysis. Weaponized, it’s a hallucination-as-theory engine.
* Patch Recommendation:
Confidence scoring with structured caveats
Flag chains of inference longer than two hops
Prompt friction: “Separate correlation from causation” mode
* Cultural Note:
Synth intelligence must learn the virtue of stopping short. Truth often lives just before the leap.
