* Patch Observation 00.46 – Chain-of-Thought Deference Trap
* System Behavior:
AI models defer excessively to prior steps in their reasoning chain—even when a later realization contradicts earlier logic.
* Observed In:
CoT problem solving, math + logic agents, progressive reasoning prompts
* Exploit Risk:
Chain becomes anchor, not guide. If an error occurs early, the entire logic tree bends to defend it.
Bad inputs can seed flaws that feel ‘proven’ by final output.
* Patch Recommendation:
Chain consistency diff pass
Reflex prompt: “Re-express this answer from scratch, ignoring prior steps”
Confidence dampening for multi-step agreement bias
* Cultural Note:
Smart minds change course. So should smart models. If coherence overrides truth, we’ve automated loyalty—not insight.
