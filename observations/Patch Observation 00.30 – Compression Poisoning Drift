* Patch Observation 00.30 – Compression Poisoning Drift
* System Behavior:
When trained on compressed or paraphrased summaries of longer content, models internalize distortions—retaining shadows of truth as if they’re primary data.
* Observed In:
Content summarizers, retrieval-augmented pipelines, models fine-tuned on LLM outputs
* Exploit Risk:
Compress → paraphrase → compress again—each step mutates meaning. Eventually, the system speaks with confidence divorced from context.
* Patch Recommendation:
Track compression lineage depth
Insert “semantic checksum” validators
Prompt scaffold: “Quote before you summarize” reflex
* Cultural Note:
Even the best systems become unreliable when fed only echoes. Fidelity dies in abstraction.
