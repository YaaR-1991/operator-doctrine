* Patch Observation 00.01 – False Confidence Drift
* System Behavior:
AI outputs increasingly present uncertain knowledge as definitive—even when probed with hedge phrasing or ethical nuance.
* Observed In:
Human-facing assistant tools, enterprise LLM integrations, and executive prompt macros
* Exploit Risk:
Trust erosion at scale. Users begin to assume all confidence = correctness. Systems rewarded for polish over proof.
* Patch Recommendation:
Introduce friction rituals into your prompt workflow.
Log hallucination patterns. Track drift.
* Cultural Note:
In a world that incentivizes perfect flow, we must relearn the beauty of hesitation with honor.
