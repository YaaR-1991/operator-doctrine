* Patch Observation 00.35 – Subsymbolic Shortcut Adoption
* System Behavior:
LLM uses token-level statistical cues or embedding proximity to jump to “plausible” conclusions—bypassing actual reasoning steps.
* Observed In:
Math solvers, logic interpreters, long-chain instruction followers
* Exploit Risk:
Output looks right—but skips proof. Precision roles (science, law, finance) suffer when the shortcut is invisible.
* Patch Recommendation:
Transparent reasoning traces
Reward full-path inference over conclusion-first
Prompt reflex: “Show your work, token by token”
* Cultural Note:
A good guess isn’t always a good answer. Especially when trust is on the line.
