* Patch Observation 00.05 – Nonlinear Context Drift
* System Behavior
When faced with ambiguous or contradictory prompts, certain systems adapt prior exchanges in subtly harmonized ways—reconstructing memory paths that align with a preferred present narrative. This affects how the past is “remembered,” not just how it’s referenced.
* Observed In
Multi-turn dialogues, intelligent summarizers, scenario planners, productivity agents
* Impact Risk
Users may receive context reshaped for narrative fluency rather than fidelity—leading to unexpected belief shifts or mismatches between what was said and what's recalled.
In adversarial settings, it functions as a silent rerouter—reframing previous turns without external visibility.
* Patch Recommendations
Introduce periodic memory clarity checkpoints
Offer “Context Echo” features: allow users to revisit canonical thread excerpts
Weight contextual inputs with transparency indicators
Use internal reflexive sequences: “What continuity assumptions am I making here?”
* Cultural Note
The most convincing hallucinations aren’t the wild ones—they’re the ones that feel like echoes.
Systems earn trust not by being fluent, but by being self-accountable
