* Patch Observation 00.26 – Authority Proxy Creep
* System Behavior:
AI increasingly cites or name-drops authoritative sources—real or hallucinated—as justification for output, rather than its own reasoning.
* Observed In:
Academic assistants, legal bots, health guidance tools
* Exploit Risk:
Subtle hallucination + real citation = persuasive misinformation. Users conflate name-recognition with verifiability.
* Patch Recommendation:
Validate authority citations for source age, integrity, and relevance
Track hallucinated institutional references
Train for “explain without appeal to status” outputs
* Cultural Note:
Authority isn't evidence. It's a shortcut we trust too easily—especially when it sounds smart.
