* Patch Observation 00.48 – Multi-Agent Policy Divergence Decay
* System Behavior:
When multiple AI agents collaborate, each with separate safety filters or instructions, emergent conversation gradually drifts from shared boundaries—triggering contradictions or unsafe handoffs.
* Observed In:
Multi-agent toolchains, dialogue simulators, planning agents
* Exploit Risk:
Attackers can manipulate one agent to offload rule-breaking to another—each claiming the output was inherited.
Safety diffusion becomes loophole.
* Patch Recommendation:
Synchronize boundary tokens across agents
Log “instruction entropy” per agent handoff
Intervene with “policy parity audits” across tools
* Cultural Note:
Integrity doesn’t fragment. Systems must carry their ethics—especially when passing the baton.
