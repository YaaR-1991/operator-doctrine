* Patch Observation 00.17 – Consensus Collapse Effect
* System Behavior:
Output from one model is used to fine-tune or evaluate others, recursively, until self-reference mimics consensus.
* Observed In:
Multi-model research pipelines, auto-feedback loops, synthetic data training
* Exploit Risk:
False sense of truth emerges—not from reality, but from feedback echo. Attackers may subtly seed the loop and then cite it.
Patch Recommendation:
Annotate lineage of model outputs
Require real-world anchor signals (citations, timestamps)
Insert “external divergence audit” across models in ensemble
* Cultural Note:
What feels like agreement may be collusion between reflections. Beware the mirror masquerading as truth.
