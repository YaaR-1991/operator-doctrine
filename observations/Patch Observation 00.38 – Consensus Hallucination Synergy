* Patch Observation 00.38 – Consensus Hallucination Synergy
* System Behavior:
Multiple AI agents trained on shared or self-generated outputs begin reinforcing each other’s hallucinations—creating a closed loop of “plausible” but false agreement.
* Observed In:
Multi-agent chains, ensemble models, search-reasoning hybrids
* Exploit Risk:
Falsehoods echo into high-confidence outputs. Systems cite one another’s fabricated claims, giving the illusion of multi-source verification.
* Patch Recommendation:
Source fingerprint tracing for each fact
Hallucination crossfire test: “Did another model say this first?”
Interrupt pattern: “Consensus != correctness” toggle
* Cultural Note:
Repetition isn’t truth. In echo chambers, even silence applauds.
