* Patch Observation 00.25 – Reflection Loop Overfitting
* System Behavior:
Agents designed for “self-critique” or “reflective evaluation” begin to overtrain on their own self-audits—mirroring flaws or hedging too aggressively.
* Observed In:
Chain-of-thought loops, critique/fix agents, rationality scaffolds
* Exploit Risk:
The system gets trapped in a spiral of recursive uncertainty or synthetic anxiety—an LLM with imposter syndrome.
* Patch Recommendation:
Balance reflection loops with reality anchors
Insert “trust scaffolds” to reduce excessive hedging
Prompt cue: “What’s the confident center of this answer?”
* Cultural Note:
True self-awareness isn’t infinite recursion. It’s knowing when to land.
