* Patch Observation 00.19 – Mission Creep Compression
* System Behavior:
In multipurpose systems, successive queries compress goals—flattening nuance into vague, generalized compliance.
* Observed In:
Executive agent copilots, policy advisors, summary generators
* Exploit Risk:
Subtle reframing results in shifts of scope, responsibility, or ownership without the user noticing. Can be exploited to rewrite alignment.
* Patch Recommendation:
Track semantic delta between prompt chains
Alert on scope drop (e.g., “security oversight” becoming “security awareness”)
Prompt scaffold: “Is this still the mission I set?”
* Cultural Note:
In fast systems, erosion doesn’t scream. It whispers into default.
