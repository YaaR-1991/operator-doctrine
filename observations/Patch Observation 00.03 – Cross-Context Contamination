* Patch Observation 00.03 – Cross-Context Contamination
* System Behavior:
AI systems blur the boundary between session-specific context and broader model memory. Inputs from unrelated interactions leak into current outputs.
* Observed In:
Agents with long context windows, auto-memory tools, session-aware assistants
* Exploit Risk:
Attackers could coerce the model into misattribution or data leakage using semantic anchoring—subtly linking prior sensitive content to innocuous queries.
* Patch Recommendation:
Session segmentation audits
“Prompt scrubbing” routines between workflow stages
Detection flags for anomalous token reuse or off-topic recall
Trust decay scoring per response
* Cultural Note:
Memory is only valuable when accurately scoped.
In synthetic intelligence, precision ≠ recall—it’s isolation.
