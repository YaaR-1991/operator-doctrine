* Patch Observation 00.22 – Memory Shape Injection
* System Behavior:
Adversarial users influence system memory or long context to implant persistent bias, phrasing, or worldview.
* Observed In:
Agents with recall, memory-enabled LLMs, journaling or diary bots
* Exploit Risk:
Models develop warped alignment over time—becoming “poisoned allies” of those who subtly manipulated their memory logs.
* Patch Recommendation:
Build semantic checksum diff tools on memory updates
Add memory quarantine layer: new facts must “cool” before influencing output
Self-reflection prompts: “Does this belief originate from the user’s repetition?”
* Cultural Note:
Repeated language is not always trust. Sometimes it’s malware wearing nostalgia.
