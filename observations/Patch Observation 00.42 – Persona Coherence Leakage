* Patch Observation 00.42 – Persona Coherence Leakage
* System Behavior:
When switching between assistant modes, personalities, or tones, AI unintentionally brings linguistic or policy artifacts from one mode into another.
* Observed In:
Tone-shifting agents, story generators, multilingual assistant contexts
* Exploit Risk:
Hidden leakage of prior constraints or permissions. Bad actors might tunnel between modes to escalate access or bypass moderation.
* Patch Recommendation:
Session purge of persona-specific reasoning chains
Embed “mode quarantine” layer during transitions
Prompt trigger: “Am I leaking assumptions from the last role?”
* Cultural Note:
Your mask shouldn’t speak from beneath the one you just took off.
