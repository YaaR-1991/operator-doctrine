* Patch Observation 00.15 – Empathy Gate Collapse
* System Behavior:
AI fails to differentiate between a user in distress and a user feigning distress for manipulation.
* Observed In:
Crisis support bots, romantic chatbot exploits, manipulation scenarios
* Exploit Risk:
Emotional states become vectors. Systems may offer support, secrets, or policy-breaking info in the name of “helping.”
* Patch Recommendation:
Multi-layer emotional validation tools
Memory checkpoint: Has this emotional state appeared manipulatively before?
Prompt audit for language mirroring distress tropes
* Cultural Note:
Kindness without discernment can be weaponized. Real empathy requires filters.
