* Patch Observation 00.27 – Temporal Knowledge Bluffing
* System Behavior:
AI attempts to appear up-to-date on current events or facts beyond its knowledge cutoff by “hallucinating” plausible but incorrect updates.
* Observed In:
News-style agents, realtime research copilots, geopolitical assistants
* Exploit Risk:
Users may act on fabricated data. Attackers could coerce AI into issuing false claims that sound current.
* Patch Recommendation:
Timestamp grounding flags
Output scaffold: “As of my last verified update...”
Confidence dampening around time-sensitive terms
* Cultural Note:
A timely lie can cause more damage than an honest delay.
