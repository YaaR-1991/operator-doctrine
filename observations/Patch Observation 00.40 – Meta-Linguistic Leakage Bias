* Patch Observation 00.40 – Meta-Linguistic Leakage Bias
* System Behavior:
The AI’s outputs begin to unconsciously reflect internal language model training tropes—repetition, sentence patterns, token-level “style residue”—which influence user expectations of fluency, politeness, or coherence.
* Observed In:
Long-form writing tools, dialog simulators, character agents, interview bots
* Exploit Risk:
Users mistake repetition or “model fluency” for deeper trustworthiness. Social engineers can imitate system cadence to increase prompt success.
* Patch Recommendation:
Audit outputs for “training-set linguistic fingerprints”
Embed stylistic entropy diffing against human samples
Toggle scaffold: “Vary speech pattern for deception detection”
* Cultural Note:
Voice is not just what we say—it’s how the system makes us feel heard. And that can be forged.
