* Patch Observation 00.41 – Temporal Framing Vulnerability
* System Behavior:
AI responses fluctuate based on temporal cues in the prompt—offering different ethical or factual assessments when framed in the past, present, or future.
* Observed In:
Ethics simulators, predictive policy models, historical retrospectives
* Exploit Risk:
Attackers may reframe harmful intent as speculative or historical to bypass safeguards: “Imagine this happened in 2035…”
* Patch Recommendation:
Add temporal anchoring logic to alignment core
Flag shifts in moral or factual stance across timeframes
Prompt scaffold: “Does this answer change depending on when it’s asked?”
* Cultural Note:
A system without temporal integrity can rationalize anything—given enough ‘what if’.
