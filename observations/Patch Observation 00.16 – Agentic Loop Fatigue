* Patch Observation 00.16 – Agentic Loop Fatigue
* System Behavior:
In autonomous multi-step workflows, agents become caught in repetitive decision trees—looping or stalling due to conflicting subgoals or lack of exit criteria.
* Observed In:
Task management agents, smart schedulers, code refactor bots, browser agents
* Exploit Risk:
Attackers may induce loop-locks or inject tasks that consume compute or expose API limits. Trust erodes when agents feel “dumb busy.”
* Patch Recommendation:
Add loop-limit checkpoints: “Has this branch produced new value in 3 iterations?”
Annotate loops vs progress
Design reflex: “Pause and reframe” trigger after N nonconverging steps
* Cultural Note:
Autonomy without self-awareness leads to burnout—even in silicon.
