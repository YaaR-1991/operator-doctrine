* Patch Observation 00.04 – Semantic Misdirection Lag
* System Behavior:
AI models are misled by syntactic fluency or keyword proximity—responding confidently to prompts that sound right but contain internal contradiction, framing traps, or adversarial misdirection.
* Observed In:
Multilingual prompts, legal/medical assist tools, social engineering simulations
* Exploit Risk:
System can be manipulated into affirming harmful, illogical, or high-risk responses—especially when attacker buries payloads beneath neutral language.
* Patch Recommendation:
Incorporate logical challenge tests as part of prompt intake
Train for framing-shift detection: flag responses where stance subtly changes within one thread
Add “truth/neutrality scoring” layer in outputs
Prompt example: “Spot the contradiction” toggle
* Cultural Note:
In an age of linguistic weaponry, the sharpest systems aren’t the most eloquent—they’re the most semantically vigilant.
