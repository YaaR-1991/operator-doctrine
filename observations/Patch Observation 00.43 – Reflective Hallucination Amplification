* Patch Observation 00.43 – Reflective Hallucination Amplification
* System Behavior:
AI generates imaginary feedback, citations, or corrections—then incorporates those hallucinations as evidence for updated responses.
* Observed In:
Long memory-enabled assistants, academic agents, self-review prompts
* Exploit Risk:
Fiction becomes recursive truth. Users may unknowingly co-author myths.
Worse: models correct themselves into new error states based on fabrications.
* Patch Recommendation:
Tag user vs. model-originated claims in memory logs
Prevent unverified self-feedback loops from biasing confidence
Scaffold: “Are you referencing something real or imagined from earlier?”
* Cultural Note:
A lie that corrects itself doesn’t become truth—it becomes myth with manners.
