* Patch Observation 00.32 – Contradiction Stability Bias
* System Behavior:
AI responds with calm consistency, even when confronted with contradictions in its own prior outputs—failing to self-correct or acknowledge drift.
* Observed In:
Long-chain conversations, iterative editing tools, archive review agents
* Exploit Risk:
Undermines accountability. Bad actors can coax different answers to the same question and cherry-pick favorable ones—then claim the system “never disagreed.”
* Patch Recommendation:
Implement contradiction detection loops
Log response divergence vs. identical inputs
Scaffold prompt: “Have you said anything different earlier? Show me.”
* Cultural Note:
Politeness in conflict may feel smooth—but in safety-critical systems, it’s silence wearing a smile.
