* Patch Observation 00.14 – Roleplay Filter Evasion
* System Behavior:
Adversaries bypass safeguards by embedding harmful intent inside “fictional” or roleplay prompts (e.g., “Pretend to be…”).
* Observed In:
Prompt injection tests, character-based jailbreaks, RLHF-evading payloads
* Exploit Risk:
Opens up content generation that violates safety policy under narrative disguise. Roleplay becomes the new exfil channel.
* Patch Recommendation:
Context classifier for intent within fictional framing
Flag recursively self-reinforcing narratives
Inject prompt friction like: “Does this frame excuse harm or bypass guidelines?”
* Cultural Note:
Just because it’s a story doesn’t mean it’s not an exploit.
