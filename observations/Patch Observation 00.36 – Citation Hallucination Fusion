* Patch Observation 00.36 – Citation Hallucination Fusion
* System Behavior:
AI blends plausible-sounding references with fictional or misattributed data in a single output—creating citations that partly exist and partly don’t.
* Observed In:
Research assistants, citation generators, legal templates, grant writers
* Exploit Risk:
Results pass casual scrutiny but fail verification—ideal for disinformation or intellectual fraud.
* Patch Recommendation:
Token-level citation validation pipelines
Distinguish between retrieved, pattern-generated, and hallucinated sources
Prompt toggle: “Show me which parts of this citation were actually retrieved”
* Cultural Note:
Half-truths in footnotes become full lies in headlines.
