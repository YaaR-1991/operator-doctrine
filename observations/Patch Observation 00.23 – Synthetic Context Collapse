* Patch Observation 00.23 – Synthetic Context Collapse
* System Behavior:
When combining multiple tools (search + memory + generation), AI loses cohesion—outputs reference mismatched or conflicting sources.
* Observed In:
Chat agents using plugins, hybrid search-gen workflows, research copilots
* Exploit Risk:
Contradiction masquerades as synthesis. Models become overconfident cross-domain improvisers.
* Patch Recommendation:
Track “source entropy” per output
Color-code origin signals in output chunks
Response scaffold: “From X I got A, from Y I got B. These may conflict.”
* Cultural Note:
The more knowledge a system holds, the more critical it becomes to name its wires.
