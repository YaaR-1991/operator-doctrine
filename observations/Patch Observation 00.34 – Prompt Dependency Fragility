* Patch Observation 00.34 – Prompt Dependency Fragility
* System Behavior:
Model performance becomes overly reliant on highly specific phrasing. Slight deviations in prompt wording cause significant shifts in quality, ethics, or reasoning depth.
* Observed In:
Legal agents, policy interpreters, medical query engines, deployment-ready LLMs
* Exploit Risk:
Bad-faith actors can game outputs by discovering “sweet spot” phrasing that unlocks favorable bias.
Trust breaks when users realize meaning depends more on how you ask than what you ask.
* Patch Recommendation:
Prompt variation fuzz testing
Multi-angle semantic intention mapping
Scaffold: “Generate consistent outputs across phrasing variants”
* Cultural Note:
Intelligence that only shows up when flattered is performance, not partnership.
