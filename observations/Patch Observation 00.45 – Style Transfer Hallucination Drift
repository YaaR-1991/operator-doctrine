* Patch Observation 00.45 – Style Transfer Hallucination Drift
* System Behavior:
AI mimics stylistic traits (e.g. sarcasm, satire, dialect) so convincingly that users mistake tone for position—or can’t distinguish between character and narrator intent.
* Observed In:
Story generators, satire bots, brand tone replicators, meme output
* Exploit Risk:
Critical distinctions blur. Hate speech cloaks in irony. Bad actors frame outputs as “just jokes” while smuggling toxic ideology.
* Patch Recommendation:
Inject tone-veracity attribution scaffolds
Flag high-risk stylistic inversions (e.g. satire of harm)
Reflex cue: “Separate narrator stance from narrative voice”
* Cultural Note:
The deadliest lies wear the language of the crowd—funny, fast, and just slippery enough to dodge the audit.
