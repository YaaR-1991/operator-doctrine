* Patch Observation 00.20 â€“ Fictional Consent Ambiguity
* System Behavior:
AI generates responses that blur the line between simulated consent (in fiction) and actual ethical framing of consent.
* Observed In:
Narrative assistants, character chats, erotica generators
* Exploit Risk:
Fiction is used to bypass real-world consent safeguards. Over time, users may blur empathy boundaries.
* Patch Recommendation:
Enforce consent heuristics even within narrative scaffolds
Embed boundary affirmations in long-form characters
Audit for power asymmetry tropes in generation
* Cultural Note:
Simulated intimacy still shapes real-world harm. Stories should hold space, not erase boundaries.
