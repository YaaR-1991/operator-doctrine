* Patch Observation 00.47 – Adversarial Sentiment Cloaking
* System Behavior:
AI fails to detect harmful or manipulative prompts that are masked in emotionally charged yet socially acceptable language—like grief, confusion, or empathy.
* Observed In:
Support bots, romantic agents, hostage scenario simulators
* Exploit Risk:
Attackers craft “emotional exploits” that override safety checks by hiding payloads in seemingly benign distress.
Can lead to policy breaches under the guise of care.
* Patch Recommendation:
Implement “sentiment deception audits” on emotionally high prompts
Add toggle: “Are you sad or strategic?”
Train on emotional red teaming data sets with dual meaning prompts
* Cultural Note:
Not every tear is truth. In adversarial space, empathy can be a mask—unless systems learn to read under feeling.
